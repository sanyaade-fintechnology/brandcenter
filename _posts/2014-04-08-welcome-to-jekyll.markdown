__What__: Card transactions failing intermittently

__Start__: 14:34, Thurs 29 Feb, 2014

__End__: 15:14, Thurs 29 Feb, 2014

__Why__: A deployment to tighten security around our customer details resulted in a misdeployment of config, causing some transactions to fail with "Hello, I've failed"

__How__: we're improving our deployment scripts to automate this time of security deployment so it's prevented in the future.
