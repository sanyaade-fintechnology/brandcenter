  <h2>What are we talking about?</h2>
  <p>We help small businesses run and grow by offering them a simple, convenient, affordable way to accept card payments. Good communication is important because sometimes the way you say something is as important as what you’re saying. We should be proud of what we do, and humbled by all the amazing merchants the keep us in business.</p>
  <p><em>Let’s be clear</em>  It’s our product that is innovative and we shouldn’t spend too much energy writing eg. an innovative settlement report email. Rather, our confidence in our product should come through in the way we talk about it.</p>
  <p>People don’t read long emails, people check their email on the train home. We don’t have much time to talk to people, so what we say better be relevant. We should always remember how annoying it can be to be contact by companies unnecessarily.</p>
  <p><em>Our instruction manual - designed with your trash can in mind.</em> We hope that merchants don’t need it, but the quick start guide that comes in the box needs to show just how easy it is to use SumUp. If we don’t make the effort to explain things properly, we lose people along the way.</p>
  <p><em>Magic, not witchcraft.</em> For some Bluetooth connectivity is mundane, for others it’s magic. We work on the assumption that everyone has a smartphone, but we shouldn’t assume that everyone we speak to knows exactly how to use it. Not everyone works for a tech. startup.</p>
  <p>While we’re cal to say that anyone can use SumUp, some people might need a hand getting started, or a couple of reminders along the way. It’s our job to speak to them as humans and not show off with complicated jargon.</p>
  <p>Consider the customer’s emotional state and tailor your communication to directly address their feelings. For example: if they’re curious, inform them. </p>
